Hi, there! I am Jorge from Mexico City.

As a professional, I define myself as a Computer Scientist with a special interest in ML. As an individual, I like to see myself as a curious guy always trying to avoid the comfort zone :).

**The professional *me*.**

I started my career as a Software Engineer and later I moved into the world of Data Science. I embrace the idea that to make the best out of data, theory is just as important as one's hands-on skills. Thus, I like dealing with papers and the properties of data but developing robust code and pipelines on the way too.

Right now, I work as an ML Engineer researching and applying deep learning for the healthcare industry. Previously, I researched novel methods for AutoML and Neural Architecture Search using reinforcement learning and meta-learning.

On the engineering side, I have experience with cloud infrastructure, DevOps, MLOps, management of databases and data lakes, and simple web development. I am knowledgeable in several programming languages and frameworks.


**The out-of-office *me*.**

I try to keep a balance between my professional and personal life. I particularly invest time with my loved ones. I like attentively listening to music, playing the guitar, traveling and getting to know other cultures, as well as learning languages â€” right now, I am learning Italian. I am very interested in helping the battle against climate change too.
