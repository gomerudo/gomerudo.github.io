Hi, there! 

My name is Jorge GÃ³mez Robles, and I am mexican. Currently, I am pursuing a master degree in Data Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, and my goal is to get involved in the industry after my graduation - expected by August 2019.

My main intereset is in Machine Learning and its application as reliable and robust software components. In specific, I had the opportunity to deepen into Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) as part of an internship program in cooperation with Achmea, where I developed a python package for the automatic discovery of machine learning pipelines for classification tasks. In addition, for my master's thesis I am now studying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) using deep meta-reinforcement learning to learn transferable strategies to automatically build neural networks for image classification.

Before my master studies, I worked as a Software Engineer at Oracle, where I was part of the Development Infrastructure team in charge of designing and improving the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for the Oracle Management Cloud (OMC). Later, during my break periods in my master program, I remotely contributed to XYB to build a CI workflow for an AWS ECS architecture. In older working experiences, I have performed as a software analyst and web developer.
