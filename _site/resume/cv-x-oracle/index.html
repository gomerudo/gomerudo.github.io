    <p>The first milestone in my working experience is Oracle. In January 2014, I joined the Development Infrastructure team for the Oracle Management Cloud (OMC), as a Software Developer, and I obtained the seniority level in April 2016.</p>

<p>I was the first member of the team located in Mexico, and the rest of the team was distributed in the USA and India. I was fortunate to be under the management of highly experienced and talented people. My local manager was first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/softwarechido/" target="_blank">Carlos Ordoñez</a>, and later <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-carlos-pineda-9898418/" target="_blank">Juan Carlos Pineda</a>. In the USA and India, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-guay-a793213/" target="_blank">Todd Guay</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrashekhar-vaishnav-499943110/" target="_blank">Chandrashekhar Vaishnav</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>During my time in Oracle, I executed several tasks to build the Continous Integration infrastructure for a cloud product. I developed Chef scripts for the automation of cloud environments. I started a Gradle Plugin to orchestrate the continuous delivery of 20+ micro-services in a Hudson-based pipeline. I also got involved in SRG and LRG testing, and dependency management via Artifactory. Some other remarkable works were the creation of a library to set up mocked services for lightweight development, and the enabling of a Sonar-based Code Coverage for the OMC.</p>

<p>Apart from development tasks, I had the chance to help my team through Git, Gradle, and Chef training. Also, I assisted as a technical interviewer in recruitment processes.</p>

<p>I left Oracle in 2017 to <a href="/resume/cv-u-tue/">pursue an M.Sc. degree at the Eindhoven University of Technology</a>.</p>
