  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As a side activity that allowed me to afford my living expenses during my time as a master student, I collaborated as a DevOps engineer with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/xyb/" target="_blank">XYB</a>, a small-size software company in Los Angeles. The collaboration started as a basic Continous Integration setup and escalated to a more complex AWS architecture.</p>

<p>It is possible to explain the work in two stages. In the first stage, I set up and configured a Jenkins server, on an EC2 instance, to build and deploy <em>development</em> and <em>production</em> pipelines. This part included integration with third-party services such as GitHub and Slack, different Linux management operations, and NGINX maintenance.</p>

<p>In the second stage, the architecture became ECS-based using Docker containers. Different services, including Jenkins, were dockerized and deployed via Go scripting to ECS, S3, and CloudFront.</p>
