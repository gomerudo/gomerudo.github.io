description: An OpenAI Gym environment for reproducible and comparable Neural Architecture Search with reinforcement learning. The default search space is inspired by BlockQNN and the performance estimation strategy is early-stop. It runs with TensorFlow and allows distributed training. The default datasets are CIFAR-10 and the meta-dataset. The code allows to plug-in different search spaces, performance estimation strategies, and datasets.
