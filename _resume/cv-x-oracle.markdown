In January 2014, I joined the Development Infrastructure team for the Oracle Management Cloud (OMC), 
and I obtained the seniority level in April 2016. During my time at Oracle, I helped building the 
development infrastructure of the OMC.

My main contributions were the development of scripts for the automation of cloud environments and 
the creation of a Gradle Plugin to orchestrate the CI/CD of 20+ micro-services in a Jenkins-based 
pipeline. Some other important contributions were the development of a library to create mocked 
services for lightweight development, and the enabling of a Sonar-based Code Coverage for the OMC.

<!-- Apart from development tasks, I had the chance to help my team through Git, Gradle, and Chef training. Also, I assisted as a technical interviewer in recruitment processes. -->

I was fortunate to be under the management of highly experienced and talented people throughout those years: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/softwarechido/" target="_blank">Carlos Ordo√±ez</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-carlos-pineda-9898418/" target="_blank">Juan Carlos Pineda</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-guay-a793213/" target="_blank">Todd Guay</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandrashekhar-vaishnav-499943110/" target="_blank">Chandrashekhar Vaishnav</a>.

I left Oracle in 2017 to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume/cv-u-tue/">pursue an M.Sc. degree at the Eindhoven University of Technology</a>.
