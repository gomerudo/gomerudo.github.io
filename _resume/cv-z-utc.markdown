During my bachelor's, I had the opportunity to study one semester abroad, at the <a href="https://www.utc.fr" target="_blank">Compiègne University of Technology</a>. This experience was possible thanks to the Mobility Scholarship sponsored by the <a href="https://www.ipn.mx/ingles/" target="_blank">National Polytechnic Institute</a>.

Of particular importance in this formation are the _Multi-agent systems_, and _Data Analysis and Data Mining_ courses, which had a great impact on my career and got me interested in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Apart from the academic side, this was a life-changing experience that gave me the international perspective that has motivated my whole career.
