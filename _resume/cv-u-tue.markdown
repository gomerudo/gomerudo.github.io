After spending some time in the industry as a Software Engineer, I decided to make a bet for the future. I joined the <a href="http://www.tue.nl/en" target="_blank">Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)</a>, in the Netherlands, to pursue an M.Sc. degree in Data Science. I was fortunate to have the TU/e and the <a href="https://www.conacyt.gob.mx" target="_blank">Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a (CONACyT)</a> to fund my studies through two scholarships.
 
During the two years of the program, I acquired very important skills. First, I learned about Statistics, Process Mining, Time-series Analysis, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. Second, I had the chance to test my new knowledge in the industry in an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume/cv-v-achmea/">internship at Achmea</a>. Third, I worked in a very ambitious research project under the supervision of <a href="https://joaquinvanschoren.github.io" target="_blank">dr. Joaquin Vanschoren</a>.

My overall performance and the score obtained on my thesis, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03769" target="_blank">Learning to reinforcement learn for Neural Architecture Search</a>, led to a *cum laude* mark. The research project was selected for an oral presentation at the NewInML workshop hosted within the <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019" target="_blank">NeurIPS 2019 conference</a>.
