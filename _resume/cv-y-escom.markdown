I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the <a href="http://www.escom.ipn.mx" target="_blank">Higher School of Computer Science</a> of the <a href="https://www.ipn.mx/ingles/" target="_blank">National Polytechnic Institute</a>, in Mexico. My formation focused on the foundations of Computer Science, Digital Electronics, and Software Engineering. As electives, I enrolled in the Artificial Intelligence and Image Analysis courses.

My final project for graduation was named *System oriented to mobile devices for the search of optimal touristic paths based on the public transportation network, aimed at the Tourist 2.0. Specific case: Mexico City*. The project was developed together with my fellow classmates <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fausto-noé-lima-rodr%C3%ADguez-36928b87/" target="_blank">Fausto Lima</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jujogoru/" target="_blank">Juan González</a>.

During my studies, I was granted the <a href="http://www.fundaciontelmextelcel.org/home" target="_blank">Fundación Telmex</a> scholarship, as well as the Mobility Scholarship to fund a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume/cv-z-utc/">semester abroad at the UTC in France</a>.
