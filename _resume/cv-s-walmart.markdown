I joined <a href="https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html" 
target="_blank">Walmart Global Tech</a> in 2022 to work on Neural Machine Translation. My
contributions encompass all fronts of the Data Science lifecyle: data engineering, ML modeling and
evaluation, MLOps, and deployment. This has helped me develop an end-to-end mindset when building ML 
solutions.

I have been involved in two projects: Query Translation and Item Translation â€“ both of them already 
deployed in production. The first one aims to enable search for Spanish-speakers at <a 
href="https://www.walmart.com" target="_blank">walmart.com</a>. By means of Language Detection and 
Machine Translation, we map Spanish queries to their English equivalent to allow the downstream
systems to work transparently. A paper describing our solution is available <a 
href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3543873.3587660" target="_blank">here</a>.

On the other hand, Item Translation is focused on translating the catalog of one market to one or
many target languages. We trained custom translation models and leveraged several services in the 
Google Cloud Platform to translate to French more than 100M items indexed at <a 
href="https://www.walmart.ca/fr" target="_blank">walmart.ca</a>. Currently, we are on the way to 
translate the content of <a href="https://www.walmart.com" target="_blank">walmart.com</a> to Spanish.

We continue to scale these solutions to handle more translation use cases within the company.
