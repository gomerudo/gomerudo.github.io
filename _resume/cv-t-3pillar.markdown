<a href="https://www.3pillarglobal.com" target="_blank">3Pillar Global</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.tiempodev.com">Tiempo Development</a> in Mexico) is a consultancy company with several clients around the world. My role here is in two different fronts: working with a specific client and building 3Pillar's offering portfolio in Data Science.

The specific client I work with is <a href="https://egnitehealth.com" target="_blank">Egnite Health</a>. Here, my role is that of an ML Engineer. I research state-of-the-art models in Computer Vision to solve several problems related to heart diseases. In the engineering side, I have developed internal libraries for data wrangling, model training, and other utility functions for the pipeline. Several models have been implemente from scratch with TensorFlow and are tracked with MLFlow.

With respect to the offering portfolio, I work directly with 3Pillar's Head of Data Science. My job is to create an internal portfolio of projects and infrastructure. This includes proposal of internal projects, client engement, mentoring of Jr. Data Scientists, and Data Science education across the whole company.
